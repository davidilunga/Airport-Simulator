# **Airport Boarding System Simulator**
Description: An Airplane Simulator made in Java is a software application that replicates the experience of flying an airplane. It's designed for entertainment, training, or educational purposes, providing users with a realistic or semi-realistic simulation of aircraft operation and control. With this code, I cna simulate users borading a plane. The different instances that I tackled were:

Add a new passenger 

Delete passenger from seat 

Store PassengerQueue data into a plain text file 

Load program data back from file into the PassengerQueue

Run the simulation and produce a report 

View the current Array 

Clear the current Array 

Quit


Technologies: **Java**
